# Interactive-Dashboard-using-Python

The Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring and analysing data from multiple sources. The dashboard allows users to interactively select data sources, attributes for visualization, time periods, and visualize the data in various chart types such as scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts. The project leverages the Dash framework in Python along with Plotly for interactive plotting capabilities.
